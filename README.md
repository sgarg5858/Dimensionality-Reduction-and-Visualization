PCA-maximizes variance of dataset without considering class label or ouput(UNSUPERVISED METHOD)

LDA-maximizes class separation(SUPERVISED METHOD)

Kernel PCA uses kernel trick to project non-linear data 

The standard PCA always finds linear principal components to represent the data in lower dimension. Sometime, we need non-linear principal components.

t-SNE can be used to get early insights whether or not the data is separable testing that it has some identifiable structure, and inspecting the nature of this structure. One does not need visualization of the t-SNE output to start answering some of these questions.
